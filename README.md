# Facial Recognition with FaceNet

This repository contains a Python implementation of a facial recognition system using FaceNet, MTCNN, and SVM. It extracts facial embeddings using FaceNet, trains an SVM classifier, and performs facial recognition on test images.

## Features

Detection of faces using MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network)
Extraction of facial embeddings using FaceNet
Training an SVM classifier for facial recognition
Evaluation of the classifier's performance using accuracy score
Prediction of faces on test images and visualization of results

## Requirements

Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
OpenCV
mtcnn
facenet-pytorch
scikit-learn
matplotlib
keras (TensorFlow backend)
